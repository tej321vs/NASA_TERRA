Terra 25 years Celebration from 1999 to 2025
NASA’s oldest daily Earth-viewing satellite – Terra – just turned 25 years old, and with five continuously operating instruments onboard (most taking imagery at the same time), Terra has piled up a LOT of data over the years (over 9,000 days and counting!). This data has the potential to shed light on everything from scientific processes to unique events, all while helping solve problems that affect humans. Your challenge is to use data from any or all of Terra’s five instruments to create an animated product showcasing an Earth science story and emphasizing the impacts to you, your community, and/or the environment.
